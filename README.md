👀 I’m interested in various subjects and fields, including technology, science, history and creative arts. I enjoy exploring new ideas and learning about different perspectives.

🌱 I’m currently learning and expanding my knowledge and learning more about visual thinking and how to use that in day to day communication an problem solving. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that involve innovative technologies or creative problem-solving. I enjoy working in teams and leveraging collective expertise to create impactful solutions.

📫 You can reach me through email at marije@funda.nl or connect with me on most social media platforms. I'm always open to interesting discussions, collaboration opportunities, or simply connecting with like-minded individuals.

Looking forward to connecting and exploring new possibilities!
